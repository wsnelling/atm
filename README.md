#This is the readme file for an atm password simulation program

This program is prepared by Bill Snelling in January 2018.
The program asks a user for their PIN number.
A valid PIN number has been preset to "1234".
The user makes up to 3 attempts to enter the correct pin, after which they are
locked out of their account. If the correct pin value is entered, a message
is printed and the program ends.
